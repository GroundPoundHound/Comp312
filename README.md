Repository for all Comp312 related projects.


This repository will hold all pertinent software for student Connor Gallagher enrolled in Dr. Matthew Butcher's Open-Source Computing class in Spring 2014. Currently, this repository holds next to nothing. However, by the end of this Spring 2014 semester, this repository shall contain Connor Gallagher's final project.

Thanks for reading,
