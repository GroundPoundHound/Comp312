Repository for all Comp312 related projects.


This repository will hold all pertinent software for student Connor Gallagher enrolled in Dr. Matthew Butcher's Open-Source Computing class in Spring 2014, namely my final project.

My final project aspires to be a barebones, probably only one screen game that will resemble the NES Legend of Zelda to be run on the computer. The game will be written in C++ with either the SDL or Allegro library. (I haven't decided which one yet, but I read they are reasonably similar and are both free and open source.)

The final product will have the player controlling a character sprite who can move in 8 directions and who has more than 1 frame of animation. The background will be composed of at least 2 different tiles, and there will be at least 1 item the character can pick up. I don't think there will be a goal other than to pick up the item; I'm more interested in trying to make something that works. I want to also try and make my own music and/or sound effects for the game, but I might end up using public domain stuff instead. This project is meant to be simple as I have never attempted anything like this before. The project is more about me learning the basics of game programming, spriting, and sound design with the hope of one day using these skills to create something bigger.

This is a solo project.

Thanks for reading,
CG
